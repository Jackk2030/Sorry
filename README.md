# Sorry
so all of the things that I've been working on was not anonymous but now when I'm in high school I'm going to be the computer fixer so in a way it did help me but right now I got in trouble so that's why you didn't see me reply or anything like that to like 55gms, bolt, and extension printer but now since I'm not in high school I just have a normal life. I'm not in my room any more just programing not caring about the 48 assignments that I have and now I stopped. I stopped the coding I told myself I NEED TO GET MY WORK DONE and now I did I have 3 A's 3B's and 2 C's and in a few weeks I will get those C's to B's and now I have nothing to worry about and I feel weightless and I'm happy...
